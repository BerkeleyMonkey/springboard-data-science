# Mode SQL Analytics Traning: Investigating a Drop in User Engagement


## Hypotheses
1. Growth rate drops.
2. Some users are on vacation.
3. Traffic shutdown to your site.
4. Specific Feature broken.


## Making a recommendation
* Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?
* If so, what are they and how will you test them?
* If they are questions that you canâ€™t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?
* What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?
* What, if anything, should the company do in response?
