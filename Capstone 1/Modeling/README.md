# Modeling for Seattle Airbnb Listing Price Prediction

## Problem
Applying machine learning models to predict Airbnb listing price.


## Approach
1. Apply 6 different models to get initial modeling results.
 * K-Nearest Neighbors
 * Linear Regression
 * Ridge Regression
 * Lasso Regression
 * Random Forest
 * Gradient Boosting
2. Analyze outliers for each model and pick models that might be more suitable.
3. Add more features iteratively to get better prediction.


## Deliverables
1. Modeling code & conclusion in [Python notebook](https://github.com/nicolechao/springboard-data-science/blob/master/Capstone%201/Modeling/modeling.ipynb).
