2. Are there strong correlations between pairs of independent variables?
3. Are there strong correlation between an independent and a dependent variable?


## Deliverables
1. Code & plots in [Python notebook](https://github.com/nicolechao/springboard-data-science/blob/master/Capstone%201/Inferential%20Statistics/inferential_statistics.ipynb).
