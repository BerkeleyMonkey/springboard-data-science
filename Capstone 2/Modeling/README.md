# Modeling for Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews with Tweets

## Problem
Applying machine learning models to analyze sentiment on movie reviews with tweets.


## Approach
1. Apply VADER for sentiment analysis to generate labels.
2. Apply 4 different models to get initial modeling results, on both word-level texts and character-level texts.
 * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
 * Multiplicative Long-Short Term Memory (mLSTM)
 * Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
 * Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)
3. Inpect results and tune model(s) further.
4. Compare models & come to the conclusion.


## Deliverables
1. Modeling code & conclusion in [Python notebook](https://github.com/nicolechao/springboard-data-science/blob/master/Capstone%202/Modeling/modeling.ipynb).
